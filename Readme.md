### MMC-based connection components

MMC-based connection components install and use a generic MMC dispatcher which use the following Target-Specific Client Settings from CyberArk Privilege Cloud.
| Setting                 | Description  	                                                        |

| ClientInstallationPath  | The full path of the MMC file which will be opened by the dispatcher. |
| LogonFlag               | The LOGON_FLAG the AutoIt RunAs function will use. Default is 2.      |

Any instances of `{address}` in ClientInstallationPath will be replaced with the address of the account.
